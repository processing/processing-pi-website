Follow [Get Started](../get-started) for instructions how to install this image file.

# Install Processing onto existing installation

_Alternatively_, if you already have an existing installation of Raspbian you want to keep, you can install Processing by running the following in a terminal:

```shell
curl https://processing.org/download/install-arm.sh | sudo sh
```


# Tar-balls

_Lastly_, if you are an expert user, and know your way around Linux, you can also manually download and install the compressed archives below. Those also come with a copy of Java built-in.
